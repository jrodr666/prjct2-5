  <div class="Content2">Paper mills are an important p[art of every countries economy.
People use paper evereyday for a variety of uses likes toilet
paper, copy paper, and even boxes are made from paper. Paper
mills often use trees or recled materila to make new paper. The
process of making paper is very simple and complex. Paper millls have many parts and porcesses that are
required to maike paper.The are 3 main components of every
paper mill: the stock preparation, The Paper machine, and
the Drying section. The easiest way to think of making paper
is bledning trees witrh water, laying it out in such a way that
slurry sticks together, then presing it so that the paper holds
and finally drying the sheet.</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">"The truth? Sales are up, and the industry is thriving. It’s true—about 25 years ago, it seemed that the industry was on the wane. However, specialty packaging is on the rise and paper prices are higher than they have been in years. As more and more people turn to anti-plastic lifestyles, new opportunities keep arising for the industry to meet those consumer desires. 
About 60% of paper waste is recycled, while only 9% of plastics are, which puts the paper industry in the position to replace single-use plastics like straws and plastic bags. These opportunities have been paving the way for a new and improved paper industry, so that innovative mills can produce new things to meet the eco-friendly demands of the consumer. The industry is adapting to all of the changes that come its way, and taking advantage of the challenges in the field today." -Southerfield Environmental elements </div>

But paper is more than convenient, it’s also versatile and innovative. Did you know there’s paper — pulp — in our car tires? Diapers? Our clothing? And, just as important, paper products are renewable, recyclable, and sustainable."- American forest and paper association</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">Jobs in the paper industry include manufacturing jobs, research and engineering positions, and technical jobs that focus on industry equipment maintenance and repair. Many industry jobs focus on the manufacture of paper products like stationery, newsprint, cloth paper, or other printing materials out of wood pulp or other fibers. Most modern paper mills both pulp and mill paper, and your duties include operating heavy machinery to carry out those processes. Research and engineering positions focus on different parts of the process, such as how to recycle materials to make new products or improve equipment efficiency. The qualifications to work in the paper industry typically include a high school diploma or GED certificate as well as practical training at a mill under more senior millworkers. Millwright and technician positions require an associate degree in industrial maintenance or a closely related subject. Machine operators typically learn their responsibilities on the job. In addition to education and training, you need numerous skills to be successful in the industry. Strong attention to detail, being mechanically-minded, and having excellent verbal communication are all essential. - Zip recruiter</div>
