  <div class="Content2">Paper dryers are typically arranged
in groups calledsectionsso that
they can be run at a progressively
slightly slower speed to
compensate for sheet shrinkage as
the paper dries. Some grades of
paper may also stretch as they run
through the machine, requiring
increasing speed between
sections. The gaps between
sections are calleddraws.
The drying sections are usually
enclosed to conserve heat. Heated
air is usually supplied to the
pockets where the sheet breaks
contact with the driers. This
increases the rate of drying. The
pocket ventilating tubes have slots
along their entire length that face
into the pocket. The dryer hoods
are usually exhausted with a series
of roof mounted hood exhausts
fans down the dryer section.</div>

  <div class="Content1">The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series
of internall-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Steam pressures may range up to 160
psig. Steam enters the end of the dryer head (cylinder cap) through a steam joint and condensate
exits through a siphon that goes from the internal shell to a centre pipe. From the centre pipe the
condensate exits through a joint on the dryer head. Wide machines require multiple siphons. In
faster machines, centrifugal force holds the condensate layer still against the shell and turbulence
generating bars are typically used to agitate the condensate layer and improve heat transfer.
The sheet is usually held against the dryers by long felt loops on the top and bottom of each dryer
section. The felts greatly improve heat transfer. Dryer felts are made of coarse thread and have a
very open weave that is almost see through, It is common to have the first bottom dryer section
unfelted to dump broke on the basement floor during sheet breaks or when threading the sheet.
